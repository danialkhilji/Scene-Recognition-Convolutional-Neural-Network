# Scene-Recognition-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks to identify scene of image.
It uses the dataset from the "Scene-Recognition-SVM" repository.
It shows considerable improvement in accuracy when compared with the previous scene recognition with SVM project results.
TensorFlow library is used for neural networks in Python.
Further details of the project are in the "scene_recognition_using_CNN_report" file.
